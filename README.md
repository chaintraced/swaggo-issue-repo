This repo demonstrates an issue with [Swaggo's](github.com/swaggo/swag) latest generic support, since it's not released we've forked the repo to `github.com/chaintraced/swag/cmd/swag@latest`

Once this version is installed ([Swaggo](github.com/swaggo/swag) from master branch on commit https://github.com/swaggo/swag/commit/732c0879d89dde8df85f435d43bdcd95a1ccc83f) try to run

```
swag init
```

you'll get an output similar to:

```
2022/08/23 13:27:14 Generate swagger docs....
2022/08/23 13:27:14 Generate general API Info, search dir:./
2022/08/23 13:27:14 Generating movie.CreateMovie
2022/08/23 13:27:14 ParseComment error in file /Users/chaintraced/localdev/swaggo-issue-repo/main.go :cannot find type definition: movie.field.Field[Actor]
```

serve the file with swagger eg.

```
swagger serve ./docs/swagger.json
```
